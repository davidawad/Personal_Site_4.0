I'm better now I promise. I started my high school singing career in a very unusual way. I was skipping math class freshman year and happened to see someone i knew who was just leaving music theory class. I walked in to say hello to them and the choral director, who also happened to be the theory teacher as well heard me speaking and invited me to join the program. It is definitely the experience that made high school for me. I shudder to think what kind of person I would have been wihout the guidance of The director Dr.Kenneth Brown. </div>

    I would love to do this kind of thing for a living. It's almost like an art form. It's like chipping away at marble until the product looks exactly how you imagined it in your mind. I can really take pride in a product when it comes out exactly the way I want it to. Software is just an amazing field and the internet is by far my favorite part of it.
