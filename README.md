This is my personal website. Enjoy it because I love this one. Lot's of changes will be made as this is fresh off the plate.

It uses a CNAME file to specify a namecheap domain that I've purchased in order to have davidawad.com forward to my github pages site. You can read more about it on the github docs [here](https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider/)


##Thanks for Looking!

### Huge Thanks to [Jacopo colo](https://github.com/jacopocolo) for the original codebase of my old gitub pages site, it was a huge inspiration for me.

##Lastly and most importantly would have to be [CodyHouse](http://codyhouse.co/) since they provide fantastic code snippets.
